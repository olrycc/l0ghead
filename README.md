Hello, I am l0ghead (or, ~lh) 

Usually making [Ctrl-ZINE](https://ctrl-c.club/~loghead/ctrl-zine.html) (compiling issues, as it is 
written/created by others on the Smol Web).

I started with Web dev in 2020, and that di/progressed into a deep interest in Sysadmin things. Just knowing what's what about 
a Linux server and how it works - fascinating. 

No social media of any type - not mainstream or decentralized, but "humblebragging" on those things is very pastiche at this 
point, yea? I'm usually on IRC (in #ctrl-c room via tilde.chat), or fussing with the ^C pubnix. E-mail is a favorite of mine,
too :)

Reach out anytime! loghead@ctrl-c.club
